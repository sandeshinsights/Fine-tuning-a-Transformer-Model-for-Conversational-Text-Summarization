# Dialogue Summarization with T5

Hello! Welcome to this project focused on building a system for dialogue summarization. This project is all about taking a conversation (a dialogue) and making it much shorter, like a quick summary, using an AI model.

## What this project does

Imagine you have a long chat conversation. Reading through everything to find the main points can be a lot of work. This project uses a special type of AI called a T5 model to automatically read the conversation and give you a short summary.

I used a dataset of dialogues and their summaries to teach the AI how to do this.

## How to use this project

(This part is a bit more advanced, but here's the general idea)

1.  **Get the code:** You'll need to download or clone this project to your computer.
2.  **Set up your environment:** You'll need Python and some libraries like `transformers` and `pandas`. You might need to install them.
3.  **Run the code:** The main part of the code trains the AI model and then you can use it to summarize new dialogues.

I'm still learning how to make this super easy for everyone, but I'll try to add more instructions later!

## What I learned

Building this project taught me a lot about:

*   Working with text data
*   Using pre-trained AI models (like T5)
*   Training an AI model on my own data
*   How to use libraries like `transformers`

It was challenging but also really exciting to see the AI actually create summaries!

## Future plans

I want to keep improving this project! Some ideas I have are:

*   Make the summaries even better.
*   Try summarizing different types of text, not just dialogues.
*   Maybe build a simple interface so it's easier to use without writing code.

## Thanks for checking it out!

This is a learning project for me, and I'm happy to share my progress. If you have any suggestions or spot something I could do better, please let me know!
